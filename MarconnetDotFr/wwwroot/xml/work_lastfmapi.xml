		<p>
      I needed an excuse to mess with .NET Core and was interested on learning how projects ended up on Nuget.<br/>
      The result is a small API that allow the user to get his Last.fm stats.<br/>
      This API was included in this website, and a <a href="/LastFMStats?username=chromimuk">demo page</a> was created to make sure that the data we received match what we expected.<br/>
      The Nuget package is available <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/LastFM.AspNetCore.Stats/">here</a>.
