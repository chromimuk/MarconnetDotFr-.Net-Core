		<p>
		  Civilization V is a turn-based strategy game. There are several ways to win the game and a lot of civilizations and maps to choose from. <br/>
      This application acts like a random game generator by choosing for the player the map where the action takes place, 
      the civilization the player have to incarnate and most importantly the kind of victory he must achieve (military, diplomacy, science or culture).
